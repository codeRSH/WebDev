            <h2>HTML</h2>
            <p class="html-text">HTML is a markup language and consists of mark up elements called tags. <br>
                Web browsers can directly understand HTML. <br>
                We can use blind text generators site to create Blind Text or filler text. <br>
            </p>

            <p class="html-text">
                We can use <strong>strong</strong> tag to make something <strong>bold</strong>. <br>
                The <strong>br</strong> tag is used to create a new line. It's a self closing tag. <br>
                Similarly we use <em>emphasis</em> tag to make something <em>italics</em>.
                We can use <strong>a</strong> tag to even link to other resources not just a website. Eg. <a
                    href="logo.png">HTML5 Logo</a> </p>

            <p class="html-text">
                There are block Elements which use the full browser width and force line breaks. Eg. <b>p</b> tag. The
                inline
                elements
                eg. <b>b</b> tag, don't do this and don't have any height , width etc. <br>
                All browsers provide some default margin between elements. </p>

                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p class="css-text"> CSS stands for <b>Cascading Style Sheet</b><br>
                    It is used to define how the HTML should look like. So HTML is for content and CSS is for styling.
                    <br>
                    CSS can be:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Inline (using style attribute)</li>
                        <li>Internal (using style tag within head tag)</li>
                        <li>External (using link tag within head tag and css in external file).</li>
                    </ul>
                    External CSS is the preferred way for styling as it's the most clean solution.

                        <li>Overlay the Image with Colors. Usually black to make the image darker and then it will be

                            world, selling an e-book, building a blog, etc.</li>
                        <li>Also define your audience. Ask yourself: which is the typical user that will visit my

                        <li>This is important, because you should always design with your goal and audience in mind.

                        <li>Defining the content before actually starting the design is called the content-first
                            approach. It means that you should design for the content, instead of designing a webpage
                            and then filling it with some stuff.</li>
                        <li>Define the navigation. </li>
                        <li> Define the site structure. You can draw a sitemap in this step if we're talking about a
